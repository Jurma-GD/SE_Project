# Product Overview

This is a Laravel 12 web application skeleton - a starting point for building modern PHP web applications. The project follows Laravel's MVC architecture and provides a foundation for developing full-featured web applications with routing, database ORM, authentication scaffolding, and frontend asset compilation.

The application is currently in its initial state with minimal custom functionality beyond the Laravel framework defaults.
